# GitHub Repository Setup

## Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account

2. **Create New Repository**:
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   - Repository name: `meme-vault`
   - Description: "Anonymous meme sharing platform built with React, TypeScript, and Appwrite"
   - Set to **Public** (so others can see and contribute)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Copy the Repository URL**: GitHub will show you the repository URL, it will look like:
   ```
   https://github.com/yourusername/meme-vault.git
   ```

## Push Your Code

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/meme-vault.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)

If you prefer using SSH:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/meme-vault.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Verify the Push

After pushing, you should see:
- All your files in the GitHub repository
- The commit message and history
- The repository is ready for deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Set up deployment**: Follow the instructions in [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)
2. **Configure Appwrite**: Follow the setup guide in [APPWRITE_SETUP.md](./APPWRITE_SETUP.md)
3. **Test the application**: Make sure everything works before sharing
